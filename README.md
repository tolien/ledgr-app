data-tracker
============
An open-source attempt at building something broadly similar to [daytum](http://daytum.com/).

To be absolutely clear, this is not intended to be a simple clone of Daytum;
the "plan" is to build around a publicly available API (something Daytum thus far lacks)
and to add features which I think would be useful.
